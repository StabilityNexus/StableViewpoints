# On Burning…

Is it good to burn tokens? Will it stabilize the token's price? Will it make the token's price increase?

*The price of a token (like the price of anything else) is determined by its demand and supply. If there is too much supply, compared to demand, the price will fall. Therefore, if you burn tokens, the price will go up*

Sounds convincing! Right?

Unfortunately, it is not (always) right. And, not understanding the nuances involved may lead to terrible "tokenomic" decisions.

A proper understanding of this topic is hindered by the fact that "burning" may mean different things. Furthermore, because tokens are a bit too abstract, people sometimes fail to understand that ultimately they are assets (almost) like any other.

To illustrate this, let's look at a few examples of burning of more concrete assets:

**Example 1:** A central bank wants to pump the price of its fiat currency. It happens to have a large amount of its fiat money stored in a vault. So, it goes and burns that stored fiat money.

Will this make the fiat currency’s price increase?

No. It will have no effect, because the burned money was not in the *circulating* supply anyway.

So, not surprisingly, we don't see central banks burning money. It would be pointless. But, even if they did it, it would be harmless, because they could mint more money later, if they wanted to.

**Example 2:** An oil producer wants to pump the price of oil. It happens to have a large amount of oil stored in tanks. So, it goes and burns that stored oil.

Will this make oil’s price increase?

Like in the previous example, the answer is no, because that stored oil is not in circulation, not for sale, anyway.

But, unlike the previous example, burning oil would actually be harmful, and not only in the environmental sense. The total amount of oil in the world is fixed and oil producers cannot "mint" more oil.

So, not surprisingly, we don't see oil producers burning oil. Instead, we see them agreeing to keep the oil stored (in their storage tanks or in the ground itself) and to sell less of it.

**Example 3:** A company wants to pump the price of its share. It goes, buys shares and burns the bought shares.

Will this make the share's price increase?

Yes, but not because it is burning the shares (reducing the supply). Rather because it is buying them from the market (increasing demand). Once the company has bought the shares, it is mostly irrelevant (for price) whether it keeps the shares stored or burns them.

Furthermore, like in Example 1, under certain constraints, the company can also issue more shares later. Therefore, burning the shares is mostly harmless.

**Example 4:** A central bank wants to pump the price of its fiat currency. It sells part of its reserves of other assets (e.g. gold) for its own fiat currency (or, equivalently, buys its own fiat currency using its reserve) and then burns the bought fiat currency.

Will this make the price of the fiat currency increase?

Yes. But, again as in Example 3, not because of burning. It is the act of buying the fiat currency from the market that has an effect.

Often, blockchain/crypto projects have mathematically sound token burning mechanisms.

For example, a stablecoin protocol may (and should) allow users to redeem their stablecoins for an equivalent amount of collateral or reserve assets, and may either store or burn the redeemed stablecoins. This is similar to Example 4.

Another example: a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project may have a mechanism whereby users who use its network pay fees in the network's token and the accrued fees are burned. Users who provide services to the network are rewarded with freshly minted tokens. In such a case, a high burning rate is an indication of success, because it means that people are using the network. And burning is also harmless (unlike Example 2), because the network can mint more tokens to reward the service providers.

But many web3 projects have been launched with tokens with a fixed supply and with large token allocations under the control of centralized teams. In such cases, burning tokens under the control of the team is pointless (like in Example 1) and also harmful (like in Example 2). Nevertheless, we keep seeing amateur trader moon-boys calling for burning tokens and we keep seeing web3 teams pondering burning and sometimes actually burning their tokens.

This is irrational. It is an instance of Cargo Cult Fallacy. It is a confusion of cause and effect. It is taking something that is an effect of success in one context and trying to use it is a cause of success in another context.

Let's call it the *Burning Cargo Cult Fallacy*.

And let’s be rational. If you consider your token to be valuable, don't burn it (unless you have the power to re-mint again), in the same way that you wouldn't burn dollars or oil if you did not have the power to mint them.
