# Retrospective 2023

2023 has been an incredible year for Djed and for the Alliance. We have achieved so much. Since we are a completely decentralized meta-organization that does not even have a “core team”, it is even hard to know everything that we have achieved, because we don’t always have visibility about everything that everybody else is doing. So, let's have a look at just some of our major 2023 highlights.

## Research

- 2 new versions of Djed!
  Osiris, used on Milkomeda, and Shu, used in Zephyr.

- 1 completely new protocol researched: Gluon!

- The Djed paper was accepted in a major academic conference!

- The Stablecoin article was published in the Encyclopedia of Cryptography, Security and Privacy.

- We published papers on oracles and even got a yet-unannounced research award for that.

## Development

- 3 New Djed-based or Djed-inspired stablecoins were implemented and deployed!
  We had only SigmaUSD until the end of 2022.
  Now we have COTI’s Djed, Milkomeda Djed Osiris and Zephyr as well.

- The implementation of a Gluon-based Gold-backed stablecoin on Ergo is in the last stages.

- SigmaUSD is almost completing 3 years old, and is completing yet another full calendar year without ever trading below the peg.
  It is now more integrated into Ergo's ecosystem than ever.

- We now have a native implementation of Djed with built-in privacy (Zephyr)

- Milkomeda's WSC (wrapped smart contracts) was integrated into Milkomeda Djed Osiris, to allow Cardano users to interact with this stablecoin contract directly from their cardano wallets.

## Growing Traction

- 4x increase in the number of blockchains that are benefitting from Djed.
  Besides the initial Ergo, we now have Cardano, Milkomeda and Zephyr.

- ~6x increase in the number of real followers of our Twitter account!

- ~5x increase in the number of participants in our Discord server!
