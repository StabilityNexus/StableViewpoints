# Ethereum Classic Stable Dollar (ECSD) Launches on Mainnet

We are excited to announce the launch of the [Ethereum Classic Stable Dollar (ECSD)](https://etc.djed.one/), a new stablecoin built on the Ethereum Classic network based on the Osiris version of the Djed Stablecoin Protocol. ECSD aims to bring reliable stability to Ethereum Classic’s DeFi ecosystem.

To use Ethereum Classic Stable Dollar, please visit:

[The Djed Protocol](https://etc.djed.one)

In line with Ethereum Classic’s core principles of:

- immutability (“code is law”),
- unstoppability and
- permissionless ethos.

ECSD operates autonomously through an immutable smart contract. All interactions are governed solely by the contract’s code, ensuring transparency and fairness for all users.

ECSD is also the 5th stablecoin based on the Djed stablecoin protocol and the 1st on a fully decentralized and unstoppable EVM-compatible chain.

This launch marks a significant step forward in enhancing the stability of Ethereum Classic’s ecosystem. We’re excited about the bright future that lies ahead and we are looking forward to seeing how ECSD will shape the growth of decentralized finance on Ethereum Classic’s network.

## Key Characteristics of ECSD
- Implementation version: Belus-ECSD
- Peg: USD
- BaseCoin: ETC
- Minting and Redemption Fees: 1.25%
- Reserve ratio: 300% minimum, 800% maximum
- Maximum transaction limit: Approximately $10,000 worth of ETC

[HebeSwap](https://oracle.hebeswap.com/pricedata.html)’s oracle system:

- Sources prices from CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Binance
- Updates on-chain prices every 30 seconds
- Uses three oracle nodes for price verification
- Implements outlier removal for enhanced accuracy

_Disclaimer: HebeSwap's oracle is a centralized oracle under the control of the HebeSwap team. The ECSD contract relies on this oracle and is able to tolerate price deviations of up to 1.25% in this oracle. Users of ECSD are implicitly trusting the HebeSwap team to continue providing correct price data through their oracle within this tolerance range._

## Acknowledgements
We thank the ETC Grants DAO for their support in creating this Djed-based stablecoin on Ethereum Classic and we look forward to bringing reliable stability to the broader ecosystem.

Expanding our presence to Ethereum Classic, the original EVM chain, means a great deal to us.
