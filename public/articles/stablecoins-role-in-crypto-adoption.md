# Why Stability Matters: The Role of Stablecoins in Crypto Adoption

Ever since the inception of blockchain technology, the adoption of cryptocurrencies has progressed relatively slowly despite the promise of financial freedom, decentralized transactions, and an alternative to traditional banking. One of the biggest roadblocks is volatility.

Volatility refers to how much and how frequently an asset’s price rises and falls over time. Most people from traditional markets, including those with solid knowledge of finance, consider volatility an investment risk in crypto assets. This undermines crypto as a medium of exchange and slows down its adoption rate even further.

In this article, we will spotlight the challenge volatility presents to cryptocurrencies and how this hinders their adoption. We’ll also introduce stablecoins as a solution to crypto volatility and champion stablecoins as a catalyst for mass adoption. In the end, we’ll wrap up with the contributions of the Stable Order in the world of stablecoins. Let’s dive in.

## The Challenge of Volatility in Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies empower users with more secure financial systems that do not operate on central authorities. However, as a relatively new and ever-evolving asset class, the high volatility, unlike in traditional assets, has adversely affected the cryptocurrency market. One notable effect is instability, where the price dramatically swings, and investors cannot make informed decisions. There is also a transactional risk when the value of crypto assets differs significantly at the time of completion than at the time of initiation.

Let’s take a real-world example to demonstrate how volatility causes transaction uncertainty. With Bitcoin, a transaction takes 10 to 60 minutes to complete. Peter wants to send James $80K for a closed business deal. At 11:33 A.M. GMT+3, Peter sends James one BTC, as reflected in [this chart by Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin).

If the network is not busy, the transaction is processed within ten minutes, and James checks his wallet at 11:44 only to find $78K worth of Bitcoin, as it is from the same chart. A dispute arises between the two business parties, and trust is broken. This poses a challenge.

On the note of adoption, high volatility discourages businesses and individuals from embracing cryptocurrencies for daily transactions. In fact, it reflects movements in investor sentiment away from products instead of attracting them to the potential possibilities tied to this financial model — not the very best influencer on the system.

Volatility is caused by several factors. These include price discovery, immature markets, sentiment, evolving regulations, 24/7 trading activity and market liquidity, supply-demand dynamics, and external factors like inflation and government policies.

## Stablecoins: The Solution to Volatility

In response to volatility, stablecoins have emerged as cryptocurrencies whose value is bound to another asset, gold, fiat currencies (USD, EUR), or a basket of assets, for instance. Serving their goal of maintaining value stability, stablecoins are more useful as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.

To address the challenges posed by volatility, stablecoins provide a cushion in a number of ways. Converting assets to stablecoins during times of high volatility has proven a solid way to preserve value. Because you can easily move in and out of stablecoins, they help manage risks in digital assets. Transactions initiated using stablecoins guarantee that the sent value equals the received.

A good sample use case is in businesses. When stablecoin is used, prices need no longer be adjusted to accommodate fluctuations. Stablecoins are also a base trading pair that contributes to market liquidity by providing a medium for trading other cryptocurrencies.

With time, stablecoins have also gained even more uses — and are still gaining more. They have spread their utility to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like lending protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Yield farming, lending, and borrowing in DeFi require a stable collateral and lending asset to foster growth and sustainability. In applications like these and others, stablecoins trade goods and services over blockchain networks, and they are used in decentralized insurance solutions, prediction markets, and derivative contracts.

For people living in regions with unstable fiat currencies, stablecoins enhance financial inclusion. The accessibility of stable crypto markets encourages people to participate in a global economy powered by digital transactions. By encouraging usability, stablecoins accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

## The Stable Order: Revolutionizing Stablecoins for DeFi and Crypto Stability

The crypto ecosystem is witnessing robust evolution, and stablecoins are a bridge between the gap in the volatility of digital assets and the stability seen in traditional finance. As more people seek to join crypto, it’s crucial to lower the entry barrier, instill confidence, and get them started quickly and painlessly, and stablecoins do exactly that.

Thanks to their stability, stablecoins are an attractive option for investors and newbies alike. New use cases for stablecoins are emerging daily, whether in trading, transfers, or value storage. While some elements that affect price fluctuation will always be present, the stablecoins pathway makes the entire crypto market more stable. In effect, this positions stablecoins as a core pillar to the full adoption of cryptocurrencies. Institutional adoption further adds to market stability.

<u>[The Stable Order](https://docs.stability.nexus/)</u>, a decentralized organization passionate about improving stability in the world, has been researching and developing stablecoin protocols since 2020. Its Djed Stablecoin Protocol is the basis for various stablecoins that are part of the <u>[Djed Alliance](https://djed.one/)</u>. And its newest Gluon Stablecoin Protocol takes many lessons learned from Djed and revolutionizes the algorithmics of stablecoins.

These stablecoin protocols have mathematical proofs of stability, which have been formally verified using automated reasoning tools. Their implementations have undergone extensive testing and battle-testing over many years, bringing reliable stability to the blockchains where they have been deployed.

The Stable Order is continuously refining stability mechanisms, forging a future where truly decentralized stablecoins, without the need for intermediaries or operators, are the foundation of DeFi.
